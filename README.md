## Key Features

1. **🧵 Multi-threaded Conversations**: Refly introduces an innovative multi-threaded conversation system that enables seamless switching between multiple independent discussion topics. This facilitates natural thought expansion and in-depth exploration, breaking free from traditional conversation constraints while building effective Agentic Workflows in human-AI collaboration.

<br />

2. **🤖 Multi-model Support**: Integrates 13+ leading AI models including DeepSeek R1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini 2.0, and OpenAI O3-mini. Supports hybrid model usage, parallel processing, inter-model dialogue, and unified knowledge base integration.

<br />

3. **🎨 Multimodal Capabilities**: Handles diverse input formats including text, images, and files. Supports 7+ file formats (PDF, DOCX, RTF, TXT, MD, HTML, EPUB) and 7+ image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, SVG, WEBP). Enables batch selection and AI querying of files and images on the canvas.

<br />

4. **⚡️ AI-Powered Skills**: Leverages AI models to generate new content nodes from any selected canvas context. Features include AI web search, knowledge base search, smart question suggestions, and document generation. Integrates capabilities from Perplexity AI, Stanford Storm, and more into a unified workspace.

<br />

5. **🔍 Context Awareness**: Provides precise temporary knowledge base support for each conversation, ensuring accurate AI comprehension and responses. Similar to Cursor, users can flexibly select any canvas node or add references as context.

<br />

6. **📚 Knowledge Integration**: Enables importing diverse external resources and intelligently organizing them within the canvas. Build comprehensive knowledge systems and personalized thinking spaces, with semantic querying powered by RAG technology - creating a true second brain.

<br />

7. **✂️ Browser Extension Clipper**: Easily capture content from popular platforms like Github, Medium, Wikipedia, and Arxiv. Save entire web pages or specific quotes directly to your AI knowledge base, continuously building your second brain while boosting productivity.

<br />

8. **📌 Smart Citations**: Flexibly select and reference content from various sources including resources, documents, memos, and skill outputs. One-click contextual referencing enhances conversation accuracy and depth.

<br />

9. **✍️ AI Document Editor**: Features a powerful Markdown real-time editor with AI-assisted content selection, precise modifications, and refinements. Provides a Notion-like experience with advanced AI editing capabilities.
